# InventoryManagement

This is a simple **console-based Inventory Management System** built in Java using core OOPs concepts.  
It allows users to add products, update stock, delete items, search for items, view the entire inventory, and export data to a CSV file.  

## ✅ Features

### ➤ Add Product  
- Add new items with name, quantity, and price  
- Automatically updates quantity if the product already exists

### ➤ View Inventory  
- Displays all stored products with name, quantity, and price

### ➤ Update Stock  
- Modify the existing quantity of a specific item

### ➤ Delete Product  
- Remove a product entirely from the inventory list

### ➤ Search Product  
- Find a product by name and view its details

### ➤ Save Inventory  
- Exports the entire inventory to a file named `inventory.csv`  
- Because submitting assignments without files is not a vibe 😌
